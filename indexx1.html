    	<h3>PR Background</h3>
    	<p class="description">I'm the founder of C1 Revolution. Clients hire me because of my expertise in
		brand reputation and management (you can get a better sense of what that
		means over at the services page). Brand work includes Portillo's, Four
		Seasons Mexico City, Bank of America 2017 Chicago Marathon, Flowers for
		Dreams and more.<br>
		Prior to starting C1, I worked on comms teams for Walgreens, DePaul
		University, MLB's Chicago White Sox and iHeart Media.<br>
		Being curious about the industry and how people successfully navigate the
		digital revolution led me to create #theRevolutionaries, an interview series
		tackling the topic, distributed by Entrepreneur.<br>
		And last, if you haven't guessed, I love coming up with wild ideas and bringing
		them to life. Here's two projects I'm particularly proud of: Harry Potter Yoga
		and #BarackingAround (they went viral within three months of each other).

    	<h3>Freelance Writing</h3>
    	<p class="description">In the last year I've published articles in Food & Wine, munchies, Atlas
		Obscura, New York Magazine, Bitch, Tasting Table and more. This has led
		people to ask if I've made a career switch from PR.<br>
		It's actually the other way around. I went into PR because I couldn't find a job
		as a writer when I graduated from DePaul with a Master's in Journalism (my
		undergrad degree is in communication). I tried writing back then and landed
		bylines with Refinery29, Chicago Sun-Times and Forbes. However, I wasn't
		ready to hustle the way I am today.<br>
		Through my PR work, I connected with Food52's Amanda Hesser who
		encouraged me to take up writing again. Today, I write a lot more. Not
		because I'm giving up PR, but because it's a different way to publicize the
		topics I care about. One feeds the other.<br>
		As a result, I'm better equipped to help clients. Being on the other side of
		pitches helps me understand how sharp my work needs to be in order to
		break through the noise.
